# RelativePerformer
Relative Encoding of `Performer` architecture.

## Installation
Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) in a python
environment with python version larger than $3.7$.
Alternatively use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install an
appropriate python version.  Pyenv and poetry are compatible, for further
details check out the section on pyenv in the [poetry
documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/).

Then install the package in a new virtual environment using
```bash
poetry install --dev
```

You can then enter the virtual environment using `poetry shell` or run commands
inside the virtual environment using `poetry run <command>`.
